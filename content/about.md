title: About ViralKindness
---

In an unprecedented show of hope, resilience and connectedness, everyday people across the country are establishing groups to help people in need.

The purposes of the #ViralKindness Community is to provide:

1. **Hub.** A community hub where people can find or set up a support group in their area to offer or receive help.
2. **Speed.** Things are changing rapidly, and we need to be working together to look after people. This is a space to form groups, and find help across the country.
3. **Resources.** Find useful resources on how you can help, frontline and government services and useful tips.
4. **Connection.** The coming weeks will be tough and full of uncertainty. But we’re in this together, and we’ll get through by pulling together.

#ViralKindness itself was inspired by groups who sprang up organically across the world, including in the United Kingdom and Australia, in response to coronavirus.

The hub will continue to improve and grow over time. If you have feedback or suggestions contact us at <a href='mailto:viralkindness@getup.org.au'>viralkindness@getup.org.au</a>
