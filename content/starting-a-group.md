subtitle: Starting a community care group is a valuable and loving contribution to your community.

You don’t need any special experience or skills to start a group — just some spare time and passion. Below are some tips to help you start your group. If you’d like any extra advice, you’re welcome to email viralkindness@getup.org.au.

    title: Step 2. Decide who your group will support
    text: >-
      <p>The community care groups listed on this website cover a huge range of sizes — supporting an apartment block, to a few streets, the suburb, greater area, and even the state and country! The size of your group is an important decision and will impact the kind of care your group can offer and its dynamics.</p>
      <p>In most cases, starting a group focused on your street or immediate neighbourhood is the best idea. Your group can then maintain a manageable size and its members will live in close enough proximity to provide practical help. Smaller groups also make online conversation easier and are less intimidating for neighbours who are using an online group for the first time.</p>
