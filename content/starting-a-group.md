  friendly online space for neighbours to request and offer help. You don’t need
  any special experience or skills to start a group — just some spare time and
  passion. Below are some tips to help you start your group. If you’d like any

      Facebook Groups is an easy tool that allows you to create an online group,
      connect with lots of people and have multiple conversations going at once.
      It’s also the most commonly used social media platform. Alternate options
      are WhatsApp groups or NextDoor.


      Once you’ve created your group, [click here to add your group to the
      ViralKindness website](/register) so that other people can search for and
      join your group.

      <p>The community care groups listed on this website cover a huge range of
      sizes — supporting an apartment block, to a few streets, the suburb,
      greater area, and even the state and country! The size of your group is an
      important decision and will impact the kind of care your group can offer
      and its dynamics.</p> <p>In most cases, starting a group focused on your
      street or immediate neighbourhood is the best idea. Your group can then
      maintain a manageable size and its members will live in close enough
      proximity to provide practical help. Smaller groups also make online
      conversation easier and are less intimidating for neighbours who are using
      an online group for the first time.</p>
