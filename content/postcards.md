title: Postcards
subtitle: >-
  <p>Across Australia, people are putting postcards in their neighbours’ letterboxes to offer assistance with everyday tasks like picking up groceries and medication, and even walking the dog.</p>
  <p>Sending your neighbours a postcard connects with people most at risk — like older people, people with underlying health conditions or whose immune system is compromised — while they self-isolate and choose to keep a safe distance. It’s also a great way to let neighbours know about your local group (if you’ve started one) and introduce yourself and the help you can provide.</p>

  text: >-
    <ol>
      <li>Head here to fill in your postcards with details or print the postcards and write how you can help. Remember to wash your hands first.</li>
      <li>Add in your name, street address or suburb, and contact number.</li>
      <li>Select from the list of options how you are able to help your community.</li>
      <li>After waiting 24 hours (see note), wash hands or wear gloves to drop postcards in letterboxes around your neighbourhood.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Note: Coronavirus is spread person-to-person, but can also be spread by touching surfaces. New research shows the virus can survive on cardboard for up to 24 hours. If you feel unwell, or have had contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus please do not deliver postcards until you have cleared the 14 day self-isolation period. Always wash your hands before posting anything.</p>
