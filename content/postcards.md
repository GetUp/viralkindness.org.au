  <p>Across Australia, people are putting postcards in their neighbours’
  letterboxes to offer assistance with everyday tasks like picking up groceries
  and medication, and even walking the dog.</p> <p>Sending your neighbours a
  postcard connects with people most at risk — like older people, people with
  underlying health conditions or whose immune system is compromised — while
  they self-isolate and choose to keep a safe distance. It’s also a great way to
  let neighbours know about your local group (if you’ve started one) and
  introduce yourself and the help you can provide.</p>
