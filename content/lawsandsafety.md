There are people on every street in the country who could do with a friendly phone call, and helping hand during the coronavirus crisis. **That’s why it’s vital we continue to safely reach out to these neighbours and provide essential care.** By being creative, we can meet the needs of isolated and vulnerable people whilst following health and social distancing rules. 

Health and legal advice is changing rapidly. **This page aims to keep you updated about the rules guiding tasks we might help our neighbours with.** 

**Stay updated**

Each state and territory has its own health and legal advice, each of which is updated frequently. Please make sure you regularly visit your state’s page for the latest rules and guidelines:

**Essential care activities are allowed**

Providing care to someone who is unable to leave the house is an essential activity if they can’t get it done without your help, eg. delivering groceries, walking their dog and getting prescriptions filled. It is possible to reach out to your neighbours while following the current rules at all times.

Wherever possible, reach out to people in your community online or on the phone. When this is not possible, use your exercise walk to distribute community care postcards or put up posters on your way to do your shopping.

**Keep your distance**

Avoid physical contact as much as possible, keep 1.5 metres distance from others, and use tap and pay instead of cash where possible. If you are feeling unwell, have symptoms, or been around someone who may have coronavirus, do notNOT provide support or care to others. 

**Wash your hands**

If you’re delivering essential items to someone or helping them with an urgent household task, wash your hands before you touch anything belonging to them and again as soon as you go home.
