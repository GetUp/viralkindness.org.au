subtitle: We’re all in this together
blurb: >-
  <p>\#ViralKindness is a hub for community care groups across Australia that
  support neighbours in need or isolation during the coronavirus crisis. Groups
  provide an online space for neighbours to connect, request and offer help —
  whether it’s shopping for food, picking up medicine, or a regular check-in
  call. Even when we’re apart, there are lots of ways we can help each
  other.</p> <p>Anyone can start a community care group for their apartment
  block, street or neighbourhood — check out the tips on the \[“Starting a
  Group” page](/start-a-group) and then \[add your group to this
  hub](/add-a-group) so others can find it. Otherwise \[search for groups near
  your suburb](/#groupSearch) in the search bar below, and groups will be listed
  below the map in closest order to you.</p>
