blurb1: >-
  <p>\#ViralKindness is a movement of community care groups across Australia
  that support neighbours in need or isolation during the coronavirus crisis.
  Anyone can start or join a local group. You can ask for help or offer a hand
  with essential tasks like shopping for food, picking up medicine, a regular
  check-in call and so much more. Because even when we’re apart, there are lots
  of ways we can help each other.</p>
