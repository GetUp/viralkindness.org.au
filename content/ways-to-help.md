      Across Australia (and even the UK!), people are putting postcards in their
      neighbours’ letterboxes to offer assistance with everyday tasks like
      picking up groceries and medication, and even walking the dog. Reaching
      out to your neighbours via postcard is a great first step to letting them
      know about your local group (if you’ve started one) and introducing
      yourself and the help you can provide. But you don’t have to make the
      postcards yourself! [Click here to download a beautiful postcard template

      Physical distancing can be a very isolating experience – especially for
      those without strong social support networks or access to technology. A
      first step to identifying people in need in your area is to [print and
      letterbox postcards using this handy tool](/postcards).  Once you’ve
      connected, set up a regular time for a phone or video call. A check-in can
      be a simple but powerful way of looking after your neighbours and getting
      to know them better. You could also try teaching someone over the phone
      how to sign up to your online group if you have one.

      Usually, most people don’t have much time to get to know their neighbours.
      But right now is a great opportunity to connect. You can start by inviting
      your group to join an online meet-up over Skype, Zoom or other video call
      programs. You could run a skill-share, training, or start a book club, or
      trade gardening tips. Or just catch up for a drink or cup of tea online!

      Vulnerable people, or those in mandatory self-isolation, may not be able
      to go grocery shopping or pick up other items for their household.
      Delivering food and other supplies to vulnerable people is allowed under
      the new laws, but just be sure to do it safely.


      To drop off goods:


      * Leave all deliveries in an agreed location, like at the front door, in
      the driveway, or under an awning out of the weather

      * Maintain a safe distance at all times (minimum 1.5 metres)

      * Practise good hygiene, including washing your hands before and after
      buying and dropping off supplies 

      * Remember the virus can survive for up to 24 hours on cardboard and even
      longer on surfaces like plastic

      To fill a neighbour’s prescription, just make sure to take along their: 


      1. Medicare card details

      2. Concession and/or Department of Veteran’s Affairs health card details
      (if they have one)

      3. PBS Safety Net entitlement or concession card (if they have one)


      You may also have to sign a document at the pharmacy to say you are
      collecting the medicine on their behalf.

      You will have to agree in advance how you will pay for shopping,
      medication or other necessities. Always make sure to get a receipt.
      Shopping for people will work best when people know each other, live in a
      similar community e.g a school, or live near each other.


      Payment apps such as [Beem It](https://www.beemit.com.au/), or methods
      such as PayID are great for people who already use them, or who are
      comfortable using smartphones. Once you’ve set it up, payment will be
      easy. Otherwise, use regular banking methods. *Note: Some stores are not
      using cash at the moment to help minimise the spread. If in doubt, call
      ahead and ask or use electronic payment methods.

      A home-cooked meal is a wonderful thing and sharing freshly made food with
      your neighbours is a great way to limit waste and help out someone in
      need. But before you start, make sure you’re following the right steps to
      make and deliver food safely.


      Here are some things to keep in mind:


      1. Make sure you’ve discussed any food allergies or intolerances with your
      neighbour and let them know what you’ll be cooking.

      2. Practise good food safety, like preparing raw meat and seafood first
      and cleaning down your utensils and work surfaces afterwards, avoiding
      cross-contamination of potential allergens like nuts, and keeping food
      refrigerated wherever possible.

      3. Wash your hands before cooking, and at regular intervals while
      preparing food.

      4. Ensure a contactless delivery by leaving food at your neighbours door
      when they are home and are able to collect the food quickly and safely.

      5. Wash any serving dishes, containers and cutlery after they have been
      returned to you.

      If your neighbour is self-isolating or doesn’t feel comfortable going
      outside, they might appreciate your help walking their dog. This is a
      great way to help out and also stay active.

      Accessing government services can be confusing, and, right now, processes
      and eligibility are changing frequently. With increased demands and
      coronavirus restrictions, a lot of these services have moved online. 


      You can help your neighbours by offering to phone them when they are
      making an online application or accessing a service. By doing this, you
      can answer questions, and provide moral support. Even better, you could
      organise a video call using Zoom and ask them to share their screen with
      you as they go through the process on their desktop.

      For a lot of people, using the internet and other technologies can be
      confusing – but these technologies are more important than ever. When
      checking in with neighbours, particularly the elderly, it’s a great idea
      to offer help with things like accessing the internet, ordering goods and
      services and or downloading apps.


      While it may be a little tricky at times, you can provide a lot of help
      over the phone or on a video call. A little patience can make a world of
      good – ensuring people have the independence to order groceries or the
      ability to see their loved ones on the screen.

      Navigating rental law during coronavirus can be confusing for renters and
      landlords alike. Many tenants, possibly even your neighbours, may find
      themselves struggling to pay rent as they lose shifts or even their jobs. 


      The Prime Minister has announced a temporary ban on evictions but the
      details are complicated. [You can find out more information about tenancy
      laws during coronavirus
      here](https://www.tenants.org.au/blog/renting-and-covid-19-information) as
      well as local tenancy services in your state and territory for up to date
      advice. 


      Most rental details have been left to individual landlords and tenants to
      negotiate depending on their circumstances. If your neighbour is renting
      their home, you can help them out by referring them to local tenancy
      services, or assist them in writing a letter for their landlord or agent. 


      If you’re worried about your legal rights or the rights of your neighbour,
      it’s important to contact a community legal centre or tenancy service for
      advice. If you’re looking for legal advice, here’s where to start:

      People may not have access to the help they normally receive around the
      house at this time. Some people will find simple things like a blown light
      bulb or an overgrown lawn difficult to fix on their own.


      If you plan to help a neighbour with repairs in their house, it’s very
      important to maintain careful hygiene, clean wipe doorknobs and light
      switches after use, and touch as little in the house as possible. It is
      especially important to maintain a 1.5m distance between yourself and your
      neighbours while indoors – preferably remaining in different rooms if you
      can.


      For yard work like watering plants or lawn mowing, make sure to wash your
      hands before touching any tools and disinfect any handles or surfaces you
      have touch

      Helping out a neighbour can be as simple as taking out the trash. Why not
      offer to take the neighbours bins out to the curb each week? Just be sure
      to wash your hands thoroughly before and after, and don’t forget to return
      them again!

      We’re using the postal system more than ever, and your neighbours may have
      parcels they are unable to collect from the post office. This is a great
      way of helping out, but [be sure to take this completed form with you to
      ensure a smooth pick
      up](https://auspost.com.au/content/dam/auspost_corp/media/documents/Collection-Authorisation-form.pdf).
      You’ll need your neighbour’s signature, but remember that paper can carry
      the virus for up to 24 hours so wash your hands before and after handling
      it. If you’re making a trip to the post office, why not offer to take
      along any mail your neighbour might want to send out?

      Perhaps there’s an eldery neighbour on your street you say hello to, but
      haven’t had time to get to know. Now’s a great time to become a penpal.
      There’s no trick to it, just write a letter introducing yourself, share
      anything you like, and invite them to write back to you. A handwritten
      letter can really make someone’s day, especially people isolated from
      their friends and family, and without access to or confidence with digital
      communication. You could even get your kids involved by having them make
      artworks to deliver to some neighbours, with a few encouraging words.

      With a lot less going out and a lot more staying in, we’re all going to
      need a few good books. Setting up a street library can be a great way to
      trade books while also maintaining a safe distance! [There’s a great guide
      on how to make your own here. ](https://streetlibrary.org.au/build/)


      To keep each other safe, you should include a sign in your library
      reminding people that the virus can survive on paper and cardboard for up
      to 24 hours. Books should be handled carefully, and left in a safe place
      for a day or so before you get stuck into reading them. Be sure to wash
      your hands!


      A wonderful twist on this idea is to set up a street pantry or [blessing
      box](https://www.timeout.com/sydney/news/this-community-street-pantry-has-become-a-beacon-of-human-kindness-under-isolation-040820).
      Instead of just filling the shelves with books, help out your neighbours
      by leaving long life food, vouchers, and other supplies and gifts. You can
      let your neighbours know in your ViralKindness group or flyer local homes.


      If you’d like to set up a street pantry in your area, it’s important to
      take the lead on organising and sanitising the box regularly, or finding
      volunteers who are happy to help out. Your pantry should contain
      information informing neighbours that coronavirus can survive on surfaces
      like plastic for days, and so hand hygiene is very important.

      During these difficult times, people around the country (and the world!)
      have come up with creative ways of brightening up their streets and
      suburbs. Like, the [teddy bear
      hunt](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-25/coronavirus-bear-hunts-around-the-world-including-melbourne/12085168)
      or the [Big New Zealand Easter Egg
      Hunt](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2020-04/nzegghunt-A4b.pdf).
      With many kids home from school, this can also be a great way of
      encouraging creativity and providing kids with something fun to look out
      for while out for a walk.
