      Across Australia (and even the UK!), people are putting postcards in their
      neighbours’ letterboxes to offer assistance with everyday tasks like
      picking up groceries and medication, and even walking the dog. Reaching
      out to your neighbours via postcard is a great first step to letting them
      know about your local group (if you’ve started one) and introducing
      yourself and the help you can provide. But you don’t have to make the
      postcards yourself! [Click here to download a beautiful postcard template
      and learn more about using postcards safely and effectively.](/postcards)

      Physical distancing can be a very isolating experience – especially for
      those without strong social support networks or access to technology. A first step to identifying people in need in your area is to [print and letterbox postcards using this handy tool](/postcards).  Once
      you’ve connected, set up a regular time for a phone or video
      call. A check-in can be a simple but powerful way of looking after your neighbours and
      getting to know them better. You could also try teaching someone over the phone how to sign up to your online group if you have one.

      Usually, most people don’t have much time to get to know their neighbours. But right now is a great opportunity to connect. You can start by inviting your group to join an online meet-up over Skype, Zoom or other video call programs. You could run a skill-share, training, or start a book club, or trade gardening tips. Or just catch up for a drink or cup of tea online!

      Vulnerable people, or those in mandatory self-isolation, may not be able
      to go grocery shopping or pick up other items for their household.
      Delivering food and other supplies to vulnerable people is allowed under
      the new laws, but just be sure to do it safely.


      To drop off goods:


      * Leave all deliveries in an agreed location, like at the front door, in
      the driveway, or under an awning out of the weather

      * Maintain a safe distance at all times (minimum 1.5 metres)

      * Practise good hygiene, including washing your hands before and after
      buying and dropping off supplies

      * Remember the virus can survive for up to 24 hours on cardboard and even
      longer on surfaces like plastic


      **Can I fill a neighbour’s prescription?**


      Sure! Just make sure you take along their:


      1. Medicare card details

      2. Concession and/or Department of Veteran’s Affairs health card details
      (if they have one)

      1. PBS Safety Net entitlement or concession card (if they have one)


      You may also have to sign a document at the pharmacy to say you are
      collecting the medicine on their behalf.


      **How should I pay for it?**


      You will have to agree in advance how you will pay for shopping,
      medication or other necessities. Make sure whatever you agree on, you get
      a receipt when you do the shopping!


      Shopping for people will work best when those people know each other, live
      in a similar community e.g a school, or live near each other.


      Payment apps such as [Beem It](https://www.beemit.com.au/), or methods
      such as PayID are great for people who already use them, or who are
      comfortable using phones. Once you’ve set it up, payment will be easy.
      Otherwise, use regular banking methods.


      \*Note: Some stores are not using cash at the moment to help minimise the
      spread. If in doubt, call ahead and ask or use electronic payment methods.


      **Is it safe to drop off home cooked meals?**


      A home cooked meal is a wonderful thing and sharing freshly made food with
      your neighbours is a great way to limit waste and help out someone in
      need. But before you start, make sure you’re following the right steps to
      make and deliver food safely.


      Here are some things to keep in mind:


      1. Make sure you’ve discussed any food allergies or intolerances with your
      neighbour and let them know what you’ll be cooking.

      1. Practise good food safety, like preparing raw meat and seafood first
      and cleaning down your utensils and work surfaces afterwards, avoiding
      cross-contamination of potential allergens like nuts, and keeping food
      refrigerated wherever possible.

      1. Wash your hands before cooking, and at regular intervals while
      preparing food.

      1. Ensure a contactless delivery by leaving food at your neighbours door
      when they are home and are able to collect the food quickly and safely.

      1. Wash any serving dishes, containers and cutlery after they have been
      returned to you.

      If your neighbour is self-isolating or doesn’t feel comfortable going
      outside, they might appreciate your help walking their dog. This is a
      great way to help out and also stay active.

      For a lot of people, using the internet and other technologies can be
      confusing – but these technologies are more important than ever. When
      checking in with neighbours, particularly the elderly, it’s a great idea
      to offer help with things like accessing the internet, ordering goods and
      services and or downloading apps.


      While it may be a little tricky at times, you can provide a lot of help
      over the phone or on a video call. A little patience can make a world of
      good – ensuring people have the independence to order groceries or the
      ability to see their loved ones on the screen.

      Navigating rental law during coronavirus can be confusing for renters and
      landlords alike. Many tenants, possibly even your neighbours, may find
      themselves struggling to pay rent as they lose shifts or even their jobs.


      The Prime Minister has announced a temporary ban on evictions, but this
      has not yet come into force in all states and territories and the details
      are complicated. You can find out more information about tenancy laws
      during coronavirus here as well as find local tenancy services in your
      state and territory for up to date advice.


      Most rental details have been left to individual landlords and tenants to
      negotiate depending on their circumstances. You can help out your
      neighbours by referring them to local tenancy services, or giving them a
      hand written letter for their landlord or agent.


      If you’re worried about your legal rights or the rights of your neighbour,
      it’s important to contact a community legal centre or tenancy service for
      advice.

      During this time, people may not have access to the help they normally
      receive around the house. Small things like a blown light bulb or an
      overgrown lawn are simply fixed for some, but may be impossible for
      others.


      If you plan to help a neighbour with repairs in their house, it’s very
      important to maintain careful hygiene, clean doorknobs and light switches
      after use, and touch as little in the house as possible. It is especially
      important to maintain a 1.5m distance between yourself and your neighbours
      while indoors – preferably remaining in different rooms if you are
      comfortable to do so.


      For yard work like watering plants or lawn mowing, make sure to wash your
      hands before touching any tools and disinfect any handles or surfaces you
      have touched.


      Importantly, do not offer to help out on a neighbour’s property if you
      feel at all unwell.

      Helping out a neighbour can be as simple as taking out the trash. Why not
      offer to take the neighbours bins out to the curb each week? Just be sure
      to wash your hands thoroughly before and after, and don’t forget to return
      them again!

      We’re using the postal system more than ever, and your neighbours may have
      parcels they are unable to collect from the post office. This is a great
      way of helping out, but be sure to take
      [this](https://auspost.com.au/content/dam/auspost_corp/media/documents/Collection-Authorisation-form.pdf)
      completed form with you to ensure a smooth pick up. As you’ll need your
      neighbour’s signature, remember that paper can carry the virus for up to
      24 hours and wash your hands before and after handling it.


      If you’re making a trip to the post office, why not offer to take along
      any mail your neighbour might want to send out?

      On that note, now’s a great time to keep in touch with a friend (old or
      new!) by writing them a letter. A handwritten letter can really make
      someone’s day – and can be a particular source of comfort for older people
      who may be isolated from their family at home or in a care facility.
      Elderly people are less likely to have access to, or familiarity with,
      digital communication and a letter can go a long way.

      With a lot less going out and a lot more staying in, we’re all going to
      need a few good books. Setting up a street library can be a great way to
      trade books while also maintaining a safe distance! There’s a great guide
      on how to make your own [here](https://streetlibrary.org.au/build/).


      To keep each other safe, you should include a sign in your library
      reminding people that the virus can survive on paper and cardboard for up
      to 24 hours. Books should be handled carefully, and left in a safe place
      for a day or so before you get stuck into reading them. Be sure to wash
      your hands!

      During these difficult times, people around the country (and the world!)
      have come up with creative ways of brightening up their streets and
      suburbs. Like, the [teddy bear

      Hunt](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2020-04/nzegghunt-A4b.pdf).
      With many kids home from school, this can also be a great way of
      encouraging creativity and providing kids with something fun to look out
      for while out for a walk. We’ve come up with a couple of ideas of our own.
