    body: <p>Across the UK and Australia, people are putting notes, letters and postcards in their neighbours’ letterboxes to offer assistance with everyday things such as picking up groceries, getting medication or even walking the dog.</p><p>By helping out, we can support people most at risk while they self-isolate or choose to keep a safe social distance — older people, those with underlying health conditions and people whose immune system is compromised.</p>

        body: >-
          <ol>
            <li>Head here to fill in your postcards with details or print the postcards and write how you can help. Remember to wash your hands first.</li>
            <li>Add in your name, street address or suburb, and contact number.</li>
            <li>Select from the list of options how you are able to help your community.</li>
            <li>After waiting 24 hours (see note), wash hands or wear gloves to drop postcards in letterboxes around your neighbourhood.</li>

          <ul>
            <li><b>Availability.</b> Feel free to include details of when it is best to call or text on the card, especially if you are working or have other commitments.</li>
            <li><b>Start small.</b> Whether you’re working with a large group, or helping on your own, hand out a small amount of postcards to begin with and increase over time. That way if multiple people in your neighbourhood need help, you won’t be overwhelmed.</li>
            <li><b>Connect with others!</b> Check the ViralKindness hub for others helping in similar ways in your area. Not only will it avoid double up, you could team up to help more people!</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Coronavirus is spread person to person - but can be spread by touching surfaces. New research shows the virus can survive on cardboard for up to 24 hours. If you feel unwell, or have had contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, please <b>do not</b> deliver postcards until you have cleared the 14 day self-isolation period.</p>

          <p>Facebook groups are an easy way to connect lots of people, alternatively WhatsApp groups or NextDoor work too.</p>
          <p>For more information on starting a Facebook group, adding people to a WhatsApp group or using NextDoor, head here:</p>

          <p>If you choose to use Facebook, add a clear group description to the ‘About’ section of your page to help people decide if it’s the group for them!</p>
          <p>Make the group ‘private’ <b>not</b> ‘secret’ or ‘public’. That way you can make sure only members of your community join.</p>
      - title: Sharing the Load
        body: >-
          <p>If you’re part of a larger group, think about giving people different roles and ways to help share the work. That means more people can help add people to your group and moderate posts.</p>
          <p>For information on how to add additional Administrators for your group refer to the Facebook Help Center.</p>
