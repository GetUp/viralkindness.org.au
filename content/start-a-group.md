title: Starting a group
subtitle: >-
  Starting a community care group is a valuable and loving contribution to your
  community. The purpose of a community care group is to provide a safe and
  friendly online space for neighbours to request and offer help. You don’t need
  any special experience or skills to start a group — just some spare time and
  passion. Below are some tips to help you start your group. If you’d like any
  extra advice, you’re welcome to email <a

      Facebook Groups is an easy tool that allows you to create an online group,
      connect with lots of people and have multiple conversations going at once.
      It’s also the most commonly used social media platform. Alternate options
      are WhatsApp groups or NextDoor.


      Once you’ve created your group, [click here to add your group to the
      ViralKindness website](/add-a-group) so that other people can search for and
      join your group.

    title: Step 1. Select your online group platform
  - hash: decide-who
    text: >-
      The community care groups listed on this website cover a huge range of
      sizes — supporting an apartment block, to a few streets, the suburb,
      greater area, and even the state and country! The size of your group is an
      important decision and will impact the kind of care your group can offer
      and its dynamics.


      In most cases, **starting a group focused on your street or immediate
      neighbourhood is the best idea.** Your group can then maintain a
      manageable size and its members will live in close enough proximity to
      provide practical help. Smaller groups also make online conversation
      easier and are less intimidating for neighbours who are using an online
      group for the first time.
    title: Step 2. Decide who your group will support
  - hash: invite-neighbours
    text: >-
      Social distancing means we have to think creatively about letting our
      neighbours (many of whom we may never have met before) know about our
      groups. Here’s some ideas:


      * **POSTCARDS:** [Click here to use the postcard tool to create your own
      custom postcards to letterbox your neighbours. ](/postcards)Just make sure
      you read the accompanying legal and safety advice.

      * **SIGNAGE:** Create a sign with the name of your group and its URL, and
      secure it to a visible place on your fence, in a communal area of your
      building, or up around the neighbourhood.

      * **SHARING:** Once you have a few people join you, ask them to share the
      invitation with anyone they know in the area.

      * **GROUP NETWORKS:** Search for Facebook groups that cover your larger
      area, and ask the admin if you could share an invite to your group with
      their members. Eg. If you run a group for people living in Bay Street,
      King’s Cross then it’d be worth reaching out to a group covering Kings
      Cross suburb or Sydney’s Eastern Suburbs. Each group will care for their
      community in their own way, so it’s perfectly fine for people to be part
      of multiple groups where they exist.

      * **DIRECTORY:** [Click here to add your group to the
      ViralKindness](/add-a-group) hub so that other people can search for and join
      your group.

      If you’re starting a smaller group, like at the street level, then you may
      decide you have the time and energy to manage the group by yourself. If
      you have a larger group, you’ll need to recruit other people to help you.
      To add someone as an additional admin of your Facebook group, [click here
      to find out how and other useful group admin
      info.](https://www.facebook.com/help/1686671141596230/) Some of the roles
      you might find useful to assign are:


      * **SETUP:** Setting up a Facebook group (or other platform)

      * **IMPACT:** Writing posts regularly in the group that encourage people
      to offer or request help, and have constructive conversation

      * **SUPPORT:** Moderating posts and comments to ensure they are friendly
      and relevant, and answering group questions

      * **PROMOTION:** Inviting neighbours to the group

      * **RESOURCES:** If needed, writing support posts or resources that help
      your neighbours offer and request help
    title: Step 4. Ask others to help you manage the group
  - hash: encourage-help
    text: >-
      The aim of your group is to provide a welcoming space for people to
      request and offer help. Some groups will take off instantly, but most
      groups will require some care to make people feel comfortable, especially
      those needing help. **You can encourage people by regularly:**


      * Reminding your neighbours to post in the group if they require help.
      (Sometimes people might not be comfortable asking for help in the group,
      so you could also offer a way to get in touch privately or post their
      request anonymously.)

      * Inviting your neighbours to post or respond to requests for help when
      they are able to offer assistance.

      * Encouraging people to think about the many ways they could offer and
      accept help by listing daily tasks people might need help with. Head to
      the [“Ways to help”](/ways-to-help) page to get more ideas and info.
    title: Step 5. Encourage people to request and offer help

    title: What’s the best way to set up a Facebook group?
    text: >-
      1. Log into Facebook or create an account

      2. Click on the “Create” button in the top bar, then “Group”

      3. Add your group details:

        a. **Group name:** Ideally something that signifies that it’s very local, eg. the street name, area of the suburb or local landmark, followed by “Viral Kindness”

        b. **Add people:** Invite other members of your household or neighbours who you might already know on Facebook, and ask them to share with others

        c. **Select privacy:** “Private” is recommended so that people can find your group, but need to join before seeing the conversations and other members. The privacy settings help people feel comfortable asking for and receiving help.

        d. **Select visibility:** “Visible” (instead of “Hide”) is recommended so that people can search for and find your group by it’s name and request to join.

        e. **About:** Add a friendly, clear group description in to the “About” section of your page to help people understand what your group is about.

      4. Make an easy link to share with neighbours:

        A. In your group’s new Facebook page, click on the url and copy it

        B. Go to [https://tinyurl.com/](https://tinyurl.com/)

        C. Paste the url into the window & click the “Make TinyURL!” button

        D. Share the link on postcards and signs

      </ol>

  - hash: special-interest-group
    title: Could I create a special interest group, eg. for local parents?
    text: >-
      Yes! Cutting your group by demographic or interest is a way to provide targeted assistance to vulnerable or stressed people during this time. Keep in mind, it will still often make sense to base your group around a geographical area, for example “[Suburb] parents helping parents” group.

  - hash: already-a-group
    title: What if there’s already a few groups in my local area?
    text: >-
      In many cases, there’s room for more than one group in an area. For instance, if you can see there’s already a group for your suburb, you could focus your group on your street and surroundings. Alternatively, you could reach out to another group organiser and offer to collaborate. The more help the better!

  - hash: connect-with-other-leaders
    title: How can I connect with other group leaders?
    text: >-
      A national online network is in the works where group leaders can connect and learn from one another. [Adding your group to the ViralKindess site](/add-a-group) will allow us to let you know about it when it’s up and running.

  - hash: group-too-big
    title: What can I do if my group becomes too big?
    text: >-
      If your group has grown too large to function effectively, then it’s time for your group to split into two or more. For example, if your group currently cares for the whole suburb, split the suburb into two or more groups and ask for someone to put up their hand to lead that. People can then stay in your group or leave and join the new one that covers them.

  - hash: no-computer
    title: What if my neighbours don’t have a computer with the internet?
    text: >-
      If your neighbours have smartphones and spare data, then you can start a WhatsApp group to connect.

      group](https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/android/26000123/?category=5245251)

      * [WhatsApp: (iPhone) How to create and invite people to a
      group](https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/iphone/26000115/?category=5245251)

      If some neighbours only have home phones, you could organise in your WhatsApp or Facebook group for a few people to call those people regularly with information and questions.

  - hash: urgent-help
    title: What if my neighbour requests medical or urgent help?
    text: >-
      In an emergency, call 000 immediately, otherwise assist your neighbour to contact their doctor for advice. [Click here to access up-to-date information and other services](https://www.getup.org.au/covid19).
