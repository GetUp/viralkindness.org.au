      body: `
        <p>There are lots of ways to check in with those we know while maintaining safe social distancing -- from a quick call, to a WhatsApp message.</p>
        <p>But for people who are more isolated, or who we don’t know as well, we need to think outside the box.</p>
        <p>Across the UK and Australia, people are putting notes, letters and postcards in their neighbours’ letterboxes to offer assistance with everyday things such as picking up groceries, getting medication or even walking the dog.</p>
        <p>By helping out, we can support people most at risk while they self-isolate or choose to keep a safe social distance -- older people, those with underlying health conditions and people whose immune system is compromised.</p>
        <p><a href="/resources#postcard">A downloadable postcard, and more information about how to use them in your local area, is available here.</a></p>

      body: `
        <p>If you are helping others in the community by delivering supplies like groceries or medication -- here’s how to do it safely.</p>

        <p>To deliver food and supplies:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Leave all deliveries in an agreed location, ie. at the front door, in the driveway, under an awning out of the weather</li>
          <li>Maintain a safe distance <em>at all times</em> (minimum 2 metres)</li>
          <li>No physical contact</li>
          <li>Practice good hygiene, including wash your hands before and after dropping off supplies</li>
        </ul>

      title: 'How to pay for things like groceries?',
      body: `
        <p>You will have to agree in advance how you will pay for shopping, medication or other necessities.  Make sure whatever you agree on, you get a receipt when you do the shopping!</p>
        <p>Shopping for people will work best when those people know each other, live in a similar community e.g a school, or live near each other.</p>
        <p>Payment apps such as <a href="https://www.beemit.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beem</a>, or methods such as PayID are great for people who already use them, or who are comfortable using phones.  Once you’ve set it up, payment will be easy. Otherwise, use regular banking methods.</p>
        <p><em>*Note: Some stores are not using cash at the moment to help minimise the spread. If in doubt, call ahead and ask or use electronic payment methods.</em></p>
