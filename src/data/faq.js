      body: `
        <p>There are lots of ways to check in with those we know while maintaining good social distancing -- from a quick call, to a Whatsapp message.</p>
        <p>But for those in our communities who are more isolated or who we don’t know as well, we need to think outside the box.</p>
        <p>Across the UK, and Australia, people are putting notes, letters and postcards in their neighbours letterboxes offering assistance with everyday things like picking up groceries, getting medication or even walking the dog.</p>
        <p>Helping out in this way means that those most at risk -- older Australians, people with underlying health conditions and those who are immunocompromised -- are looked after and supported while they self-isolate or proactively social distance.</p>

      body: `
        <p>If you are helping others in the community by delivering supplies like groceries or medication -- it’s your responsibility to do so safely.</p>

        <p>
          To deliver food and supplies safely:
          <ul>
            <li>Leave all deliveries in an agreed location ie at the front door, in the driveway, under an awning out of the weather</li>
            <li>Maintain a safe distance at all times (minimum 2 metres)</li>
            <li>No physical contact</li>
            <li>Practice good hygiene, wash your hands before and after dropping off supplies</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

      title: 'How to pay for things like groceries?',
      body: `
        <p>You will have to agree in advance how you will pay for shopping, medication or other necessities.  Make sure whatever you agree on, you get a receipt when you do the shopping!</p>
        <p>Shopping for people will work best when those people know each other, live in a similar community e.g a school, or live near each other.</p>
        <p>Payment apps such as PayID and Beem would be great for people who already use them, or who are comfortable using phones.  Once you’ve set it up, payment will be easy. Otherwise, use regular banking methods.</p>
        <p><em>*Note: Some stores are not using cash at the moment to help minimise the spread. If in doubt, call ahead and ask or use electronic payment methods.</em></p>
