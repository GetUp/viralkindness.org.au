        <p>There are lots of ways to check in with those we know while maintaining good social distancing -- from a quick call, to a Whatsapp message.</p>
        <p>But for those in our communities who are more isolated or who we don’t know as well, we need to think outside the box.</p>
        <p>Across the UK, and Australia, people are putting notes, letters and postcards in their neighbours letterboxes offering assistance with everyday things like picking up groceries, getting medication or even walking the dog.</p>
        <p>Helping out in this way means that those most at risk -- older Australians, people with underlying health conditions and those who are immunocompromised -- are looked after and supported while they self-isolate or proactively social distance.</p>

        <p>If you are helping others in the community by delivering supplies like groceries or medication -- it’s your responsibility to do so safely.</p>

        <p>
        To deliver food and supplies safely:
        • Leave all deliveries in an agreed location ie at the front door, in the driveway, under an awning out of the weather
        • Maintain a safe distance at all times (minimum 2 metres)
        • No physical contact
        • Practice good hygiene, wash your hands before and after dropping off supplies
