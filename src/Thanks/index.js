            Without question, the way we pull through coronavirus is together
            and by caring for those around us.
            <strong>
              To do that, weâ€™re going to need everyone who can, to do a little
              more to help.
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Can you share your group with family, friends and neighbours and
            encourage them to join you?
