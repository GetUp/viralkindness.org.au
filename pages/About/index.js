        <p>
          In an unprecedented show of hope, resilience and connectedness,
          everyday people across the country are establishing groups to help
          people in need.
        </p>
        <p>The purposes of the #ViralKindness Community is to provide:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Hub.</strong> A community hub where people can find or set
            up a support group in their area to offer or receive help.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Speed.</strong> Things are changing rapidly, and we need to
            be working together to look after people. This is a space to form
            groups, and find help across the country.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Resources.</strong> Find useful resources on how you can
            help, frontline and government services and useful tips.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Connection.</strong> The coming weeks will be tough and full
            of uncertainty. But we’re in this together, and we’ll get through by
            pulling together.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          #ViralKindness itself was inspired by groups who sprang up organically
          across the world, including in the United Kingdom and Australia, in
          response to coronavirus.
