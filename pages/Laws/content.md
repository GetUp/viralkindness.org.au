If you are feeling unwell or have symptoms do not provide support or care to others.

Follow the current health guidelines at all times, such as washing your hands regularly, keeping 1.5 metres distance from others and using tap and pay.

Reaching out to people in need:

- Wherever possible reach out to people in your community online or on the - phone
- Use your exercise walk to distribute community care postcards
- Put up posters or signs on your way to do your shopping
- Get the job done while following the current rules at all times

Providing essential care to someone who is unable to leave the house is an essential activity if they can’t get it done without your help.

Essential activities include:

- Shopping for and delivering groceries and other essentials
- Delivering home cooked meals
- Getting a prescription filled at the pharmacy
- Walking the dog
